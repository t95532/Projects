AMCAT Data Analysis
The AMCAT (Aspiring Minds Computer Adaptive Test) dataset contains information about candidates' academic 
performance, skill set, and demographics. The dataset aims to provide insights into factors influencing employability and 
job performance.
• Importing Data and Initial Exploration
• Summarize statistical information about numerical variables, such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, 
and quartile values. 
• Univariate Analysis
• Numerical Variables: Perform Probability Density Function (PDF) analysis, Histograms, Boxplots, and Count plots to 
understand the distribution of each numerical variable. Identify outliers in each numerical column and understand their 
impact on the data. Analyse the frequency distribution of each numerical column.
• Categorical Variables: Analyse the frequency distribution of each categorical variable/column using Count plots. Make 
observations after each plot to highlight any significant patterns or trends.
• Bivariate Analysis 
• Numerical-Numerical Relationships: Discover relationships between numerical columns using Scatter plots, Hexbin 
plots, Pair plots, etc. Identify correlations or patterns between numerical variables.
• Categorical-Numerical Relationships: Explore relationships between categorical and numerical columns using Swarm 
plots, Box plots, Bar plots, etc. Understand how categorical variables influence numerical outcomes. 
• Categorical-Categorical Relationships: Investigate relationships between categorical variables using Stacked Bar plots. 
Identify any dependencies or patterns between different categorical variables
