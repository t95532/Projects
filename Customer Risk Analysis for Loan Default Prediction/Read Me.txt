Customer Risk Analysis for Loan Default Prediction
The objective of this project was to develop a predictive model to identify customers with a higher risk of loan default. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn.
• Data Analysis and Preparation: Conducted a comprehensive analysis of customer data to understand key features and patterns associated with loan default. Preprocessed the data using Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas, handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the distribution and relationship of variables.
• Model Development: Utilized Scikit-Learn, a machine learning library in Python, to develop predictive models.
Employed various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting to assess and predict the likelihood of loan default. Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance and generalization ability.
• Model Evaluation and Optimization: Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Conducted hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize model parameters and improve predictive accuracy. Implemented feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant variables contributing to loan default prediction.
• Deployment: Developed a web-based application using Flask, for deploying the predictive model. Integrated the trained machine learning model to enable real time loan default prediction. Implemented user interface component to allow users to input customer data and receive predictions on the likelihood of loan default. Deployed the application using AWS EC2 for accessibility and scalability.
• Outcome: The project resulted in the development of a scalable and efficient solution for real-time loan default prediction. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and deploying the predictive model using Flask and AWS EC2, the solution offers valuable insights to financial institutions for assessing customer risk and making informed lending decisions.
