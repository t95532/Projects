Diabetes Dataset Analysis

Overview
This repository contains a dataset related to diabetes, which includes information about various factors such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI (Body Mass Index), diabetes pedigree function, age, and the outcome (target variable) indicating whether an individual has diabetes or not.

Features
Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies the individual has had.
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration after 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history).
Age: Age of the individual (years).

Target
Outcome: Binary indicator of diabetes (1: Yes, 0: No).

Usage
This dataset can be used for various machine learning tasks, such as classification to predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes based on the given features
